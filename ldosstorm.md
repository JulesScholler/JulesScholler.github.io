## Mapping the LDOS with super-resolution

This work was done during my research internship when I was in my third year at ESPCI. I worked with Dorian Bouchet under the supervision of Ignaccio Izzedin.

You can find our publication on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02778).

### Purpose

Our aim was to measure the LDOS. Wait, what's that? The **L**ocal **D**ensity **O**f **S**tates (LDOS) is a physical quantity. It can be roughly understand as the number of states that can be occupied by a photon. It is space resolved, meaning that the LDOS depends on where you are on a medium, it is a local property that can explain material behavior. Indeed, the LDOS is involved in the way the light interact with matter. The aim of the project was to image the LDOS in 2D (at the interface between two medium) with a super-resolution.
