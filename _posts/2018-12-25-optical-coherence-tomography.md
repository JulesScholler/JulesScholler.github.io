My research focuses on using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to image biological samples. In this post I am going to explain the principle and limitations of traditional OCT.

## What is the purpose of OCT

OCT is an imaging technique used to acquire images in scattering samples with micrometer resolution. A scattering sample is a sample that interacts with light. We say that it scatters the light, meaning that, during the propagation of light inside the sample, the light will not travel straight but will be deviated (possibly multiple time. There is a famous example to explain this phenomenon, take a look at the following picture:

![Cloudy mountain](../img/cloud_mountain.jpg){: .center-image }

we can distinguish 3 cases for the propagation of light:

1. Ballistic light, this light is not scattered even once. You can clearly see through and in order to image ballistic light you can use a basic camera.
2. Single scattered light, this light as been scattered exactly once (on average). It is still possible to see through (because some photons are still not scattered, scattering is a random process!). In order to image in single scattering media it is still possible to use a basic camera and a little bit of post processing can do the trick to improve the image quality.
3. Multiple scattered light, this light as been scattered multiple time and it is not possible to see through anymore with conventional imaging method.
