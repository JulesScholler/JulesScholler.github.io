In this post I will describe the idead behind Dynamic Full Field Optical Coherent Tomography (DFFOCT). If you don't know about FFOCT I suggest that you should read my previous post [here](https://www.jscholler.com/2019-01-18-ffoct/).

## Why Dynamic FFOCT

Let's say you are imaging a living organism, it could be either 3D tissue or cell cultures. Because there are sub-cellular motion

Remember the image formation equation for FFOCT:

$$ I_{camera}(x,y) = I_{incoh}(x,y) + 2\sqrt{R_s(x,y) R_r}cos(\Delta \phi(x,y)) $$

If the sample is fresh/alive then there is no reason why the coherent term should remain constant and the image formation equation becomes:

$$ I_{camera}(x,y) = I_{incoh}(x,y) + 2\sqrt{R_s(x,y,t) R_r}cos(\Delta \phi(x,y,t)) $$
