Léo Puyo, a third year PhD student working in my team, developed a new technique based on holography called **L**aser **D**oppler **H**olography (LDH) and he is able to produce stunning movies of the retinal blood flow. A popular technique already exists for imaging of the retinal vasculature called **O**ptical **C**oherence **T**omography **A**ngiography (OCTA). With this method, clinicians are able to map the retinal vasculature in 3D. The only drawback being that the temporal resolution is not sufficient to see the heartbeat and that the method is not yet quantitative.

On the contrary, LDH has a very high temporal resolution (the camera is working at $75~000~kHz$) which enables the visualisation of the blood flow. Léo is working on making it quantitative, i.e. extract absolute flow measurements. An example of the videos LDH can generates is shown below.
