[QBI conference](https://www.quantitativebioimaging.com/qbi2019/) is a bioimaging conference, centered on quantitative aspects of different imaging techniques. We presented our work in a presentation and in a poster session.

Here are some videos of our results shown on the poster. **If you want to obtain original files without watermark for a presentation or a course, feel free to leave a comment or send a mail (click on the mail icon in the footer)**.

## 3D stack of a retinal organoid

This video shows a stack in depth of a 26-day-old retinal organoid. We can see different structures, while going through the sample, with a very active center. 

It is possible to represent a part of the organoid in 3D to see the organization of the different cells.

29-day-old organoid

We can see changes on these organoids: the shape, the cells (type). Some cells are dying.
