In this post I will explain how we can listen to living cells (yes dead cells are unfortunately silent) inside 3D tissues.

**Disclaimer:** we will not actually listen to actual sound waves created by cells and recorded by a microphone, but we are going to construct song based on cell activity.

## Signal recording

The technique used to probe the signals is **D**ynamic **F**ull-**F**ield **O**ptical **C**oherence **T**omography (D-FFOCT) which you can read about [here](https://www.jscholler.com/2019-01-28-dffoct/). As a reminder the experimental setup is displayed below:

INSERT FIG HERE

The idea behind **O**ptical **C**oherence **T**omography (OCT) is the same as ultrasound imaging, the main difference being that it is not possible to generate and measure pulses in optics hence listen to light echoes. Therefore we need a smart way to discriminate light coming from several layers inside the sample. With OCT the smart idea is to generate interferences in the layer we aim to image. If you are not familiar with this you can learn more on OCT [here](https://www.jscholler.com/2019-01-28-ffoct/).
