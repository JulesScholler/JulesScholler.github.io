Below are animations to support the poster presented at ELMI 2021, where we present an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing large 3D cleared tissue samples such as whole mouse brains or large human brain sections, achieving 100+ times faster computation. In addition to faster processing, the adaptive particle representation (APR) [1] yields memory and storage compression ratios ranging from dozens to thousands depending on the labeling sparsity.

## APR conversion

For APR conversion, parameters were set automatically using the Li thresholding method on the intensity thresholded gradient and local intensity fluctuations. We used a mouse whole brain acquired on a mesoSPIM. Eventhough the labelling is not sparse, the computational ratio (total number of pixels divided by total number of particles) was **17** and the memory compression ratio was **23** (which could be further compressed). At the end of the video we increase the gamma display in order to display larger particles in the background.

## APR stitching

After conversion, stitching can be done directly on APR by evaluating the pairwise registration between each neighboring tile and globally optimizing for a reliability measure. Each tile is only read once leading to a very efficient implementation, from 20 to 1000 times faster than TeraStitcher [2].

## APR segmentation

We use Napari as a backend to efficiently display APR and created a tool to manually annotate dataset efficiently (labels are stored in a sparse array to keep the memory requirement low) and automatically sampled on the underlying APR data. We compute per-particle features by adaptive convolutions and any particle classification method (e.g. random forests like in iLastik [3]) can then be used to segment the data efficiently.

## APR registration to atlas

Merged APR data can be reconstructed efficiently at a lower resolution and registered to the Allen Brain Atlas (25 µm here) for more in-depth analysis. Here we used Brainreg [4] to perform the non-rigid registration.
