Now that the website seems to be working as expected I can write my first post. I have decided to build a website because of the following reasons:
- I was really curious about how you build a website
- I wanted to explain what I am doing during my PhD (every week there are people asking what I'm doing and because most of the things I do are somehow visual and not so easy to explain with words, I'll try to cover that in this website).
- I think that sciences and research should be spread widely and maintain a website explaining what you do and why is a great way to do so.

I was highly inspired by some fellow PhD/researchers and I will try to keep this up to date. For now there are only technical stuff (project and publications) dedicated to what we would call specialists, or at least scientific people. In a close future I will try to post about my experiments aiming at *normal* people, i.e. non-scientist, by popularizing as much as possible. In the mean time, if you spot an error or a typo, feel free to leave a comment.

Stay tuned!
