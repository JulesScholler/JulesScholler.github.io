At the beginning of my PhD I switched from Matlab to Python, here I'll explain why and develop the pros and cons of using Python for your scientific research.

## Why switching in the first place?

To be honest I was very happy with Matlab (who would not when you know how much they charge!) but I decided to go full open source for my PhD (it's like being vegan but online!) because I think that we should spread our knowledge and projects in order for everyone to be able to use it. In the academic field more and more people are using Python and the more people are using it, the better it gets with more modules and libraries.
