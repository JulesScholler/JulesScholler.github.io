## APR conversion

Parameters were set automatically using the Li thresholding method on the intensity thresholded gradient and local intensity fluctuations. We used a mouse whole brain acquired on a mesoSPIM. Eventhough the labelling is not sparse, the computational ratio (total number of pixels divided by total number of particles) was 17 and the memory compression ratio was 23. At the end of the video we increase the gamma display so as to display larger particles in the background.
