You can find my preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00810).

DFFOCT is very promising for 4D microscopy with diffraction limited resolution and also for eye imaging. In this paper I present two methods, (i) a **S**ingular **V**alue **D**ecomposition (SVD) based filtering method that automatically removes artifact arising from sample axial motion during the acquisition, and (ii) a new operator based on non-stationnarities to compute the dynamic in order to improve the signal to noise ratio.

## SVD filtering for motion artifact removal
