We have done this trip in August 2019 during summer holidays. It is a 2 days hike in the French Alps.

We started the ascent from *Refuge des Evettes* in order to save time (the goal was to reach the summit before midday in order to avoid difficulties on the glacier). There are a lot of ways to get there, we parked our car in *L'Êcot* and hiked to *Refuge des Evettes* the day before, it took us aournd 1h30.

From *Refuge des Evettes* to *Pointe Francesetti* the details are shown below. It took us 4h to reach the summit, we took our time to enjoy the amazing landscapes and to put on the crampons on the Glacier.
