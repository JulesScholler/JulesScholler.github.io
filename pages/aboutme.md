I'm currently part of the team at *Clee Medical* in Geneva, where we’re developing an innovative imaging device aimed at transforming the field of neurosurgery.

My academic background is rooted in physics and biomedical imaging. I completed my *PhD* at the Institut Langevin in Paris under the supervision of Prof. Mathias Fink, Prof. Claude Boccara, and Dr. Kate Grieve. My research focused on advancing dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography (OCT) and applying it to in vivo retinal imaging.

Before that, I earned my engineering degree (MSc level) from *ESPCI Paris*, where I majored in *physics* and minored in chemistry and biology. I then pursued a specialized MSc in *applied mathematics*, with a focus on *machine learning and computer vision*, at *École Normale Supérieure*.

When I’m not immersed in imaging and AI, you’ll most likely find me climbing, skiing, mountaineering, or unwinding with a good crime novel.
