So this project was a lot of fun. It was proposed by Regaind on [Challenge Data](https://challengedata.ens.fr/en/home). I teamed up with [Leo Paillier](https://github.com/leo-p) and we ended up [winning](https://www.sciencesmaths-paris.fr/upload/Contenu/MathsInfos/MathsInfos37_web.pdf) this challenge without using Neural Networks. Our report is available [here](/pdf/Report_REGAIND.pdf).
