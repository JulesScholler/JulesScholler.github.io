We have done this trip in October 2019 with a colleague after a summer school in Corsica. It is a 3 days hike in the very center of the island. In order to get there you will need a car and go to Corte, then take the D623 to the end of the Restonica Valley where you can park (6â‚¬/day). Our idea was to make a loop from the Valley to explore the surroundings, which are wonderful, see below for more details.


## Day 1: *Restonica Valley* to *Refuge de la Sega*

We started the first day around 10:30 from the *Bergerie de Grotelle*. It took us 6h to arrive at Refuge de la Sega.
